### Problem Statement
Local installment shop owners face significant challenges in managing their businesses efficiently due to reliance on outdated paper-based systems. These systems result in manual and time-consuming processes for tracking customer payments, managing product inventory, and maintaining records. As a result, installment shop owners often struggle with operational inefficiencies, inventory discrepancies, and poor customer service. There is a pressing need for a digital solution that streamlines operations, improves inventory management, enhances customer communication, and ensures a seamless installment-based purchasing experience for both shop owners and customers

### Background Study:

- These businesses offer financial flexibility to customers who may struggle with large upfront payments.<br>

2. **Current Practices:**

- Installment shop owners often rely on manual, paper-based systems for managing customer payments and product inventory.
- Communication with customers is primarily in person or via phone calls.

3. **Existing Technologies:**

- Generic point-of-sale (POS) systems and inventory management software may not fully meet the needs of installment shop owners.
